-- What would be the effect of replacing <= by < in the original definition of `qsort`?

It will ignore duplicated values.

For [2, 2, 3, 1, 1], we have:

      qsort [2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
  =
      qsort [a | a <- [2, 3, 1, 1], a < 2] ++ [2] ++ qsort [a | a <- [2,3,1,1], a > 2]
  =
      qsort [1, 1] ++ [2] ++ qsort [3]
  =
      ...
  =
      [1] ++ [2] ++ [3]
  =
      [1, 2, 3]
